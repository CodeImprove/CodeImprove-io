            We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing a non-rigidly
            deforming scene using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones.

          <p>
            Our approach augments neural radiance fields
            (NeRF) by optimizing an
            additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a
            canonical 5D NeRF.
            We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and
            propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for
            more robust optimization.
            By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like
            models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further
            improves robustness.

            We show that <span class="dnerf">Nerfies</span> can turn casually captured selfie
            photos/videos into deformable NeRF
            models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary
            viewpoints, which we dub <i>"nerfies"</i>. We evaluate our method by collecting data
            using a
            rig with two mobile phones that take time-synchronized photos, yielding train/validation
            images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully
            reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high
            fidelity.
